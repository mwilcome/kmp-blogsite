# Angular Web App

This is a standard Angular application with one addition:
it consumes JavaScript generated by the Kotlin Multiplatform project.

Angular is the **entry point** for web development.

---

## How It Works

Running the app requires only one command:

```bash
npm start
````

This does the following, in order:

1. Runs a Gradle task in the KMP project
2. Builds Kotlin `shared-logic` for JavaScript
3. Copies the output into `src/vendor/shared-logic`
4. Starts the Angular dev server

After that, Angular behaves like any normal Angular app.

---

## Important Notes

* Angular does **not** build Kotlin directly
* Angular does **not** know about Android or Compose
* The Kotlin output is treated like vendor code

Anything under `src/vendor/shared-logic` is generated.
Do not edit it manually.

## Local Dev

After running `npm start`, the app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:4200
